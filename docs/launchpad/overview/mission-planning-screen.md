available then the map gets zoomed into the user, otherwise you are zoomed into the previously planned mission.

There are 5 other options right below the menu button. They are (from top to bottom):

- `Single tap Geo-fence`

All you have to do to create the drawing is ensure that the `Add/Remove Vertices` symbol is looking like a negative
sign. Then tap anywhere on the screen a black target looking icon will be displayed where you had tapped.
